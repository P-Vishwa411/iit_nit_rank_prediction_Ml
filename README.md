### IIT NIT Rank Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the admission ranks for IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology) and NITs (National Institutes of Technology) using machine learning techniques. The model was trained on a dataset comprising five years of historical admission data from Kaggle. 
The primary objective is to forecast ranks based on various features and historical patterns, providing a valuable tool for prospective students and academic institutions.

Features
Historical Data: 5 years of admission data including features such as student scores, exam patterns, and ranks.

Predictive Model: Machine learning model trained to predict IIT and NIT admission ranks.

Tools & Technologies: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, Jupyter Notebook.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle and includes:

Features: Student performance metrics, examination results, and historical admission data.
Target Variable: Admission ranks for IITs and NITs.

Workflow

Data Collection

Download the dataset from Kaggle.
Load the data into a pandas DataFrame for preliminary exploration and analysis.
Data Preprocessing

Cleaning: 
Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct data inconsistencies.
Feature Engineering:
Create new features if necessary, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyze the data distribution, visualize feature relationships, and identify patterns.
Generate summary statistics and visualizations to understand the data better.
Model Building

Split the Data:
Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
Select Algorithms: 
Test various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
Train the Model:
Fit the model on the training data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
Model Evaluation

Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Compare different models and select the best-performing one based on evaluation metrics.
Model Deployment

Save the Model:
Serialize the trained model using joblib or pickle.
GitHub Repository:
Upload the project files, including code and model artifacts, to GitHub.
Documentation

Provide a comprehensive README file with project description, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.
Include a detailed explanation of the model's performance and potential use cases.
